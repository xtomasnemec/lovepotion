# LÖVE Potion

[LÖVE](https://love2d.org) for Nintendo Homebrew.

You can find the API reference and how to start making your own games [on the Wiki!](https://lovebrew.org)

# Testing

To test LÖVE Potion, you must first intialize the submodules:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

Then you can use the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/lovebrew/lovepotion/releases/latest) and use the submodule content as your game directory. Alternatively, making a fused game with the content is possible as well.
